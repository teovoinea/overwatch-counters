# Counterwatch.co

Hello. Welcome to the [Counterwatch.co](https://counterwatch.co) GitHub Repo. Ultimately this project was a result of a) me being bored but also b) me wanting to create something useful-ish and kind of fun for the game I've been enjoying so much the past few months. 

One of the things that I often struggle with is deciding which hero to switch to if the one I'm on currently isn't working. I look and see that the enemy team has a Junkrat, for example, which would suggest switching to say, a Pharah. However, maybe they also have a Soldier or McCree, at which point it's just target practice. So I wanted to make something that would take the entire opposing team into account before suggesting a pick.

Honestly, it's a pretty simplistic tool. It generally works by looking at the team comp you've entered for the opposing team, adding each hero that is strong against those heroes to a list, and then aggregating and displaying the heroes that appeared most often. It shows the top six because I'm arbitrary that way, and six is a nice number in Overwatch.

## Potential Future Improvements

There are a few things I'd like to add if this proves useful to people. 
* A "Don't pick" list - kind of like the opposite of what it gives you now. This would show the heroes you should _not_ pick in that circumstance.
* Some way of filtering by type - so if you only wanted to see tanks or healers, for instance.

I'm open to suggestions in the [Issues section](https://github.com/rspilhaus/overwatch-counters/issues) if there is something you think would help!
